Behaviour Trees - Homework 1

------Assumptions------

Assumption (1): The robot doesn't spend more than 25% of its battery when performing 
SPOT cleaning and GENERAL cleaning consequitvely. This means that the robot's battery will 
never drop below 30% while it is executing any of the tasks.

Assumption (2): The robot can find its home to go and charge even when it has 0% because it
has a back-up battery that activates in such circumstances.

Assumption (3): If the battery level is below 30%, the robots goes back to the dock to recharge. It
recharges back to 100% after staying in dock for 3 secs. 

Assumption (4): The percentage cost of battery for each specific task is not considered. Therefore, in the
beginning of each loop, the user is asked for the battery level. Then, based on the input battery
level, the tree executes accordingly. 

(The reason why a cost for each individual task wasnt assigned is because in the homework desciption, except 
for done general and done spot, tasks were described to do nothing other than printing statements and modifying 
the state.)

Assumption (5): The result of the clean-floor task is determined at random with a low probablity.
