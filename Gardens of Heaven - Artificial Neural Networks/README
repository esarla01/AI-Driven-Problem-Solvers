Assumptions:
1- The neural network has been trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset of flowers.
2- The four physical features used for classification are relevant and sufficient for accurately identifying the different types of flowers.
3- The hidden layer in the neural network is able to extract relevant features and patterns from the input data for accurate classification.
4- The activation functions used in the hidden layer and the output layer are appropriate for the task of flower classification.
5- The network has been trained using an appropriate optimization algorithm and loss function.
6- The network has been tested on a separate, unseen dataset and has achieved a high accuracy score.
7- The network is able to generalize to new, previously unseen data and correctly classify previously unseen flower types.
