# AI Problem Solvers

This repository contains a series of AI-driven projects, each tackling famous computational problems using core artificial intelligence concepts. Every solution is built from scratch, ensuring a deep understanding of the algorithms and techniques involved. The projects explore various domains of AI, such as neural networks, classification, constraint satisfaction, genetic algorithms, search algorithms, and behavior trees.

### Projects:

- **Gardens of Heaven - Artificial Neural Networks**: A project that uses neural networks to solve complex pattern recognition problems, specifically focusing on image classification or similar tasks.
- **Radar Trace Classifier - Naive Bayes Classification**: Implementing Naive Bayes classification to analyze radar data and categorize different radar trace patterns.
- **Sudoku Solver - Constraint Satisfaction Problems**: A project that applies constraint satisfaction algorithms to solve the Sudoku puzzle efficiently.
- **The Knapsack Problem - Genetic Algorithms**: Solving the Knapsack optimization problem using genetic algorithms, exploring the use of evolutionary principles to find an optimal solution.
- **The Pancake Problem - Informed Search**: An AI-driven solution to the Pancake Problem, applying informed search techniques such as A* or greedy algorithms to find the shortest sequence of flips.
- **Vacuum Cleaning Robot - Behavior Trees**: A simulated vacuum cleaning robot, controlled by behavior trees to navigate and clean an environment efficiently.

Each project provides a practical demonstration of AI techniques, implemented with the goal of solving well-known problems from scratch, helping to build a solid foundation in AI concepts and algorithms.
