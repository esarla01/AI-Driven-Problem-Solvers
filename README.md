# AI Problem Solvers (CS131 Tufts)

This repository contains a collection of projects completed as part of the **CS131 course** at **Tufts University**. The focus of these projects is on solving well-known problems using **artificial intelligence concepts**, with all implementations built from scratch. The goal is to explore AI concepts through hands-on problem-solving without relying on external libraries.

## Projects

- **Gardens of Heaven** - Artificial Neural Networks
- **Radar Trace Classifier** - Naive Bayes Classification
- **Sudoku Solver** - Constraint Satisfaction Problems
- **The Knapsack Problem** - Genetic Algorithms
- **The Pancake Problem** - Informed Search
- **Vacuum Cleaning Robot** - Behavior Trees

Each project addresses a famous problem, demonstrating the application of various AI methodologies, and is intended to showcase fundamental AI techniques in a clear and accessible way.

### Features:
- **Custom AI implementations**: All algorithms are implemented from scratch.
- **Focus on classical AI problems**: Tackling widely known challenges with AI approaches.
- **Educational resource**: A hands-on collection of AI problem-solving techniques.

Feel free to explore the projects and dive into the AI concepts behind each one.
